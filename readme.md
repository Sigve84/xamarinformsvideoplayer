videotestNative is a Xamarin Ios native project, and videotest is a Xamarin Forms project. 

To test issue:

Enable voice over in Settings -> Accessability -> Vocieover

videotestNative
Every button in the view should be able to be selected, and voiceover should be able to tell you what kind og buttons the videocontrol has. Example play button, pause button etc.

videotest

Xamarin Forms implementation of the video player. If voice over is enabled you are not able to select the buttons, and the voice over are not able to read out which button you are selecting. The video player should work in the same way as native implementation.
